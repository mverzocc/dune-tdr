ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-01 & Broken resistors or varistors on voltage divider boards & Redundancy of resistors, varistors, and \dshorts{hvdb}.  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-02 & \efield uniformity is not adequate for muon momentum reconstruction & Regularly map out field using a laser calibration sysem. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-03 & \efield is below specification during stable operations & Improve purity by more aggressive filtering. & M & M & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-04 & Space charge from positive ions distorting the \efield beyond expectation & Minimize insulators facing cryostat wall ground. & M & M & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-05 & Damage to \dshort{ce} in event of discharge & Minimize the energy released in a short time using highly resistive connections. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-06 & Energy stored in FC (in DP) is suddenly discharged & Delay energy discharge by connecting neighboring Al profiles with resistive sheaths.  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-07 & Detector components are damaged during shipment to the far site & Make sufficient spares and increase the number of shipping boxes.  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-08 & Damages (scratches, bending) to aluminum profiles of Field Cage modules & Make sufficient spares and increase the number of shipping boxes.  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-09 & Bubbles from heat in PMTs or resistors cause HV discharge & A large area of cathode consists of high resistance rods, delaying the energy release.   & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-10 & Free hanging frames can swing in the fluid flow &  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-11 & FRP/ Polyethene/ laminated Kapton component lifetime is less than expected &  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-12 & Lack of collaboration effort on this HV system & Continue recruiting collaborators. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-13 & International funding level for DP HVC too low & Employ cost saving measures and  recruit collaborators. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-DP-HV-14 & Underground installation is more labor intensive or slower than expected & Increase labor contingency and refine labor cost estimates. Further improve installation procedure. & L & L & L \\  \colhline

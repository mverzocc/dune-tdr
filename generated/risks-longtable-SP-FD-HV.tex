ID & Risk & Mitigation & P & C & S  \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-01 & Open circuit on the field cage divider chain & Component selection and cold tests. Varistor protection. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-02 & Damage to the resistive Kapton film on CPA & Careful visual inspection of panel surfaces.  Replace panel if scratches are deep and long  & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-03 & Sole source for Kapton resistive surface; and may go out of production & Another potential source of resistive Kapton identified. Possible early purchase if single source. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-04 & Detector components are damaged during shipment to the far site  & Spare parts at  LW. FC/CPA modules can be swapped and replaced from factories in a few days. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-05 & Damages (scratches, bending) to aluminum profiles of Field Cage modules & Require sufficent spare profiles for substitution. Alternate: local coating with epoxy resin. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-06 & Electric field uniformity is not adequate for muon momentum reconstruction  & Redundant components; rigorous screening. Structure based on CFD. Calibration can map E-field. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-07 & Electric field is below goal during stable operations & Improve the protoDUNE SP HVS design to reduce surface E-field and eliminate exterior insulators. & M & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-08 & Damage to CE in event of discharge  & HVS was designed to reduce discharge to a safe level. Higher resistivity cathode could optimize. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-09 & Free hanging frames can swing in the fluid flow  & Designed for flow using fluid model; Deformation can be calibrated by lasers or cosmic rays. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-10 & FRP/ Polyethene/ laminated Kapton component lifetime is less than expected & Positive experience in other detectors. Gain experience with LAr TPC's; exchangeable feedthrough. & L & L & L \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-11 & International funding level for SP HVS too low & Cost reduction through design optimization. Effort to increase international collaboration. & M & M & M \\  \colhline
RT-SP-HV-12 & Underground installation is more labor intensive or slower than expected & SWF contingency, full-scale trial before installation. Estimates based on ProtoDUNE experience. & L & L & L \\  \colhline

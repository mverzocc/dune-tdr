\chapter{Scientific Landscape}
\label{ch:physics-landscape}

The aim of this chapter is to set the stage for the discussions of 
DUNE's scientific capabilities that are presented in the chapters 
that follow.  This is implemented as a series of brief 
descriptions of the theoretical and experimental contexts relevant 
for key areas of the DUNE physics program. 

It is important to state at the outset that a fully comprehensive 
review is not possible here.  Rather, the descriptions presented 
in this chapter are intended to be illustrative, so as to 
convey broadly the array of scientific opportunities for which 
DUNE is designed to realize.
Furthermore, the supporting literature is vast, and it is 
not within the scope or purpose of this chapter to provide an 
exhaustive list of references. 
More details, including concrete references to the literature, 
are provided in subsequent chapters.

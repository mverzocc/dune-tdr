\chapter{Quality Assurance}\label{vl:tc-QA}\section{Overview of DUNE Quality Assurance}\dshort{dune} \dword{tc} monitors technical contributions fromcollaborating institutions and provides centralized projectcoordination functions. One part of this project coordination isstandardizing \dfirst{qa}/\dfirst{qc} practices, one facetof which is to assist consortia in defining and implementing\dword{qa}/\dword{qc} plans that maintain uniform, highstandards across the entire detector constructioneffort. Figure~\ref{fig:fnal_qa} shows how \dword{dune} \dword{tc}derives its \dword{qa} program from the principles of the \fnal \dword{qa} program:requirements are flowed down through the \dword{lbnf-dune}\dword{qa} program into the \dword{qc} plans developed for consortium fabrication ofdetector components and integration and installation of the detector.\begin{dunefigure}[\fnal QA]{fig:fnal_qa}  {Flow-down of \fnal \dword{qa} to consortia}  \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{fnal_qa.pdf}\end{dunefigure}The \dword{qa} effort includes design, production readiness, andprogress reviews as appropriate for the \dword{dune} detectorsubsystems, as was done for \dword{pdsp} under \dword{tc}oversight. Installation and operations reviews fall under \dword{jpo}oversight as is discussed in Chapter~\ref{vl:tc-review}.\subsection{Purpose}The primary objective of the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} program isto assure quality in the construction of the \dword{lbnf} facility and\dword{dune} experiment while providing protection of\dword{lbnf-dune} personnel, the public and the environment. The\dword{qa} plan aligns \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} activities, whichare spread around the world, with the principles of the \fnal QualityAssurance Manual. The manual identifies the \fnal Integrated QualityAssurance Program features that serve as the basis for the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan.The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan outlines the \dword{qa}requirements for all \dword{lbnf-dune} collaborators andsubcontractors and describes how the requirements will be met.\Dword{qa} criteria can be satisfied using a graded approach. This\dword{qa} plan is implemented by the development of quality plans,procedures, and guides by the consortia to accommodate those specificquality requirements.\subsection{Scope}The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan provides \Dword{qa}requirements applicable to all consortia, encompassing all activitiesperformed from research and development (R\&D) through fabrication andcomponent commissioning, building on the success ofProtoDUNE. Consortia are responsible for providing their deliverables,whether subsystems, components, or services in accordance withapplicable agreements. All parties are responsible forimplementing a quality plan that meet the requirements of the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan. Oversight of the work ofthe consortia will be the responsibility of the \dword{dune}\dword{tcoord} and \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa}manager.\subsection{Graded Approach}A key element of the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan is theconcept of graded approach; that is, applying a level of analysis,controls, and documentation commensurate with the potential for anenvironmental, safety, health, or quality impact. The graded approachseeks to tailor the kinds and extent of quality controls applied inthe process of fulfilling requirements. Application of the gradedapproach entails\begin{itemize}  \item identifying activities that present significant \dword{esh}    and/or quality risk,  \item defining the activity,  \item evaluating risk and control choice, and   \item documenting and approving the application of the graded    approach.\end{itemize}\section{Quality Assurance Program}The \dword{lbnf-dune} Systems Engineering teams maintain a\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{cmp}~\cite{bib:docdb82}, which identifies the \dword{lbnf} projectConfiguration Items Data List (CIDL) and Interface Control matricesthat provide the tier structure for the flow down of \dword{qa} plans,with the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan as the top tier.With theassistance of the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager, the consortia will develop specific \dword{qa} plans  forcomponent or system \dword{qa}. Due to the limited scope ofwork of some consortia, they may elect to work under the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan for their scope of work. Incase of conflict between sets of \dword{qa} requirements, \dword{dune}\dword{tc} will provide resolution.With many institutions carrying responsibility for various aspects ofthe project, institutional \dword{qa} plans will be reviewed by\dword{dune} \dword{tc} to ensure compliance with the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan. Using a graded approach,supplements to institutions existing plans will be implemented fortheir \dword{dune} scope of work, if necessary.Overall \dword{qa} supervision, including all activities describedabove, is the responsibility of the \dword{dune} \dword{tcoord}.\subsection{Responsibility for Project Management}The \dword{dune} consortium leaders manage their projects and areresponsible for achieving performance goals. The\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager is responsible forensuring that a quality system is established, implemented, andmaintained in accordance with requirements. The\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager reports to the\dword{dune} \dword{tcoord} and provides oversight and support toconsortium leaders to ensure a consistent quality program.\dword{dune} consortium leaders are responsible for quality withintheir project and report \dword{qa} issues to the \dword{dune}\dword{tcoord} and \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa}manager. \dword{dune} consortium leaders designate \dword{qa}representatives within their organization and delegate, as appropriate, work defined in the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan, asshown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dune_qa}.\begin{dunefigure}[DUNE QA organization]{fig:dune_qa}  {\dword{dune} \dword{qa} organization.}  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{dune_qa3}\end{dunefigure}The \dword{dune} consortium leaders retain overall responsibility for\dword{qa} even though they have designated a \dword{qa}representative.\subsection{Levels of Authority and Interface}The \dword{dune} Management Plan, the \dword{lbnf-dune} PMPand the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan define theresponsibility, authority and interrelation of personnel who manage,perform, and verify work that affects quality. The \dword{qa} plandefines the \dword{qa} roles and responsibilities of the \dword{dune}project.All consortium members are responsible for the quality of the work thatthey do and for using guidance and assistance that is available. Eachhas the authority to stop work and report adverse conditions thataffect quality of \dword{dune} products to their respective\dword{dune} consortium leader and the \dword{lbnf-dune}\dword{qa} manager. The consortium leader responsible for \dword{dune}components or systems is required to determine and document theiracceptance criteria. \dword{dune} personnel at each level areresponsible for evaluation of quality through self-assessments;however, independent quality assessments may also be requested byproject management.  The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager isresponsible for development, implementation, assessment, andimprovement of the \dword{qa} program.The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager is responsible forperiodically reporting on the performance of the quality system to the\dword{dune} \dword{tcoord} for review and as a basis for improvingthe quality system. The \dword{dune} \dword{tcoord} may call for\dword{qa} plan readiness assessments as the project nears majormilestones. The \dword{dune} \dword{tcoord}, consortium leaders, and\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager are all responsible forproviding the resources needed to conduct the project successfully,including those required to manage, perform, and verify work thataffects quality.\subsection{Quality Assurance Organization}\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager may request personnelfrom the \dword{dune} project to act on behalf of the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager to perform qualityassurance functions, based on need, in accordance with the gradedapproach described above. The requested personnel must possessqualifications or receive the appropriate training required to performthese functions.The \dword{dune} \dword{qa} Specialist will be responsible for thefollowing activities:\begin{itemize}	\item Cooperatively develop, monitor, and control \dword{dune}          \dword{qa} procedures to assure compliance with \dword{dune}          standards and applicable laws;     \item Provide assistance for \dword{qa}/\dword{qc} matters in project       plans, including strategizing technical solutions and       alternatives on \dword{qa}/\dword{qc} matters and assist in developing       testing plans with project team members;	   \item Participate in audits, site inspections, accident             investigations, and monitor trend analysis to identify             areas of concern and implement improvements;	\item Interact with all stakeholders on \dword{qa} issues;      \item Provide guidance and interpretation on routine and complex        \dword{qa} matters and problems; and	\item Participate in reviews at collaborating institutions.\end{itemize}Each consortium selects a \dword{qa} representative. %for the consortium.  Each consortium \dword{qa} representative is responsible foroverall coordination of quality requirements to assure they meetconsortium objectives.  The \dword{qa} representative is expected to %responsibilities include\begin{itemize}  \item oversee the consortium fabrication facilities for quality    performance;  \item interface with the \dword{dune} \dword{qa} specialist on    consortia \dword{qa} related matters;  \item monitor the status of all required testing based on the    consortium \dword{qc} plan;  \item make sufficient fabrication facility visits to determine    adequacy of \dword{qc} system performance: check certifications    of materials and equipment delivered to the facility, spot check    workmanship, observe testing procedures; and  \item make or arrange \dwords{ppr} during the fabrication cycle in    coordination with \dword{tc} and the \dword{jpo} Review Office.\end{itemize}Figure~\ref{fig:dune_qa} shows the interface between the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} organization and the consortium \dword{qa}representatives.  These interfaces will remain when the equipment isshipped to the far site for installation, but the names may change forthe consortium \dword{qa} representatives.  The consortium \dword{qa}representatives remain responsible for \dword{qa}/\dword{qc} during thedetector installation process.\section{Personnel Training and Qualification}The \dword{dune} consortium leaders are responsible for identifying theresources to ensure that their team members are adequately trained andqualified to perform their assigned work. Before allowing personnel towork independently, they must %are responsible to ensure that their teammembers have the necessary experience, knowledge, skills andabilities. Personnel qualifications are based on the followingfactors:\begin{itemize} \item previous experience, education, and training; \item performance demonstrations or tests to verify previously   acquired skills; \item completion of training or qualification programs; and  \item on-the-job training.\end{itemize}All \dword{dune} consortium leaders are responsible for ensuring thattheir training and qualification requirements are fulfilled, includingperiodic re-training to maintain proficiency and qualifications.\section{Quality Improvement and Lessons Learned}\label{sec:quality_improvement}Lessons learned have been developed and utilized by the consortia inthe development of the latest designs.  A lessons learned programguideline and worksheet has been developed for the use by theconsortia~\citedocdb{8921}.  The project is now at a stage where it isutilizing the lessons learned gathered from \dword{protodune}. Thelessons learned program remains active although the project is in thedesign phase. Lessons learned are being collected during theperformance of activities associated with \dword{iceberg},\dword{ashriver} \dword{apa} Installation Test Assembly, \dword{cern}\coldbox facility, and developments toward \dword{protodune2}.All \dword{dune} consortium members participate in quality improvementactivities that identify opportunities for improvement. They canrespond to the discovery of quality-related issues and follow up onany required actions. This quality-improvement process requires thatany failures and non-conformance be identified and reported to theappropriate consortium leader, and that root causes be identified andcorrected. All consortium members are encouraged to identify problemsor potential quality improvements and may do so without fear ofreprisal or recrimination. Items, services, and processes that do notconform to specified requirements must be identified and controlledto prevent their unintended use. Inspection and test reports orsimilar tools will be used to implement this requirement. Eachconsortium leader is responsible for reporting non-conformance to the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager, %and the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager who will periodically report these non-conformance to\dword{dune} \dword{tc}.\dword{dune} consortium members will perform root cause analysis andcorrective and preventive actions for conditions that do not meetdefined requirements. Consortium leaders may perform root causeanalysis and corrective and preventive actions under their ownprocedures or \fnal procedures.  This problem identification, analysisand resolution process for quality consists of the following steps:\begin{enumerate}  \item identify problem;  \item understand the process;  \item grade the process and identify Root Cause Analysis (RCA)    method;  \item identify possible causes;  \item collect and analyze data;  \item communicate lessons learned and document RCA; and  \item implement corrective and preventative action procedure.\end{enumerate}%\subsection{Lessons Learned}  this was a single subsection within a section%\label{sec:lessons_learned}To promote continuous improvement, \dword{dune} \dword{tc} will develop alesson learned program based on the \fnal Office of Project SupportServices Lessons Learned Program. This program provides a systematicapproach to identify and analyze relevant information for both goodand adverse work practices that can influence project execution. Whereappropriate, improvement actions are taken to either promote therepeated application of a positive lesson learned or preventrecurrence of a negative lesson learned. Lessons learned will begathered throughout the project life cycle. As part of the transitionto operations a lessons learned report will be submitted.In addition, the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager willperiodically publish a best practices and lessons learnedreport. Lessons learned from the \dword{dune} project will be screenedfor applicability to other organizations. The \dword{dune} projectwill periodically check external lessons learned sources forapplicability to the \dword{dune} project. Sources of lessons learnedinclude the \dword{doe} Lessons Learned List Server, the \fnal \dword{esh}Lessons Learned Database, and \dword{dune} team members whoparticipate in peer reviews of other projects. Reviews of the\dword{dune} project serve as input to quality improvement.\section{Documents and Records}Engineering and technical documents (including drawings) are     prepared by \dword{dune} personnel to define the design, manufacture,     construction, and installation of their equipment.  Ultimately, before these documents are put into effectthey are reviewed and signed by the \dword{dune} consortium leader ordesignee. The\dword{dune} project manages all documents under the document controlsystems: \dword{edms} and \docdb, as identified in the \dword{dune}\dword{cmp}~\cite{bib:docdb82}.  The system to control document preparation, approval,issuance to users and revision is also described there. Consortiumleaders will use the graded approach described in this plan todetermine work in their scope that requires  \dword{lbnf-dune}\dword{qa} manager review and signature. This person also reviews project documents thatcontain quality requirements. % shall be reviewed by the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager.Records are prepared and maintained to document how decisions aremade, for instance, decisions on how to arrive at a design, how torecord the processes followed to manufacture components and the meansand methods of cost and schedule changecontrol. \dword{lbnf-dune} will follow the guidelines forstoring and maintaining records for the project in accordance with\fnal Records Management\footnote{\url{http://ccd.fnal.gov/records}.}. The\dword{dune} \dword{tcoord}, \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa}manager and consortium leaders are responsible for identifying theinformation to be preserved. In addition to the technical, cost, andschedule baseline and all changes to it, records must be preserved asevidence that a decision or an action was taken, and to providethe justification for the decision or action.\section{Work Processes}\dword{dune} team members are responsible for the quality of theirwork, and consortium leaders are responsible for procuring theresources and support systems to enable their staff to complete theirwork with high quality. All \dword{dune} work will be performed usingmethods that promote successful completion of tasks, conformance to\dword{dune} requirements, and compliance with the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{ieshp}. Work processes consist of aseries of actions planned and carried out by qualified personnel usingapproved procedures, instructions, and equipment, and under administrative,technical, and environmental controls, to achieve a high-qualityresult.\subsection{Fabrication Work Processes}Fabrication work on the \dword{dune} project will be performed toestablished technical standards and administrative controls usingapproved instructions and procedures. Fabrication work processes with\dword{qa} inspections and tests will be documented on travelers thatare retained with the hardware item or %that may be retainedelectronically. Items, including consumables, will be identified andcontrolled to ensure their proper use and to  prevent the use ofincorrect, unaccepted, or unidentified items. Each consortium will definea system of controls to ensure that its items are handled, stored,shipped, cleaned, and preserved to prevent them from deteriorating,being damaged, or becoming lost. Equipment used for process monitoringor data collection will be calibrated and maintained. Work must be performed safely, in a manner that ensures adequateprotection for employees, the public, and the environment. Consortiummembers and the \dword{dune} \dword{tcoord} must exercise a degree ofcare commensurate with the work and the associated hazards. See the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{ieshp}~\cite{bib:docdb291} for more details on\dword{lbnf-dune} integrated safety management systems. \subsection{Change-Controlled Work Processes}\label{sec:change-control}Changes to design and fabrication requirements should follow thenormal revision process for design and fabrication documents ensuringthe appropriate level of verification, review and approval by therelevant consortium and \dword{tc}. The change control process flow for\dword{dune}, as currently envisioned, can be found inFigure~\ref{fig:change_control} below. A Change Control Board (CCB)led by the \dword{tcoord} advises the \dword{tcoord} on changes.\begin{dunefigure}[\dshort{lbnf-dune} change control]{fig:change_control}  {\dword{lbnf-dune} change control flow chart.}  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{LBNF-DUNE_ChangeControl_4-1}\end{dunefigure}When shop or site work must be performed before the associated %affected designdocument can be formally revised and re-issued, such changes areaccomplished through the development, approval, and distribution of an\dword{ecr}. This applies to %process is for designs that areunder configuration management. Interdisciplinary reviews areperformed when the \dword{ecr} subject matter may impact othersubsystems. The \dword{ecr} requestor  indicates whether it is a one-timechange or if the change is to be incorporated into the designdocuments. Refer to Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-change} for more information on thisprocess.  This design change control process is applicable to designchanges that may occur during fabrication and for which the change must beexpedited to avoid schedule delays. These types of changes do notaffect technical scope, cost, or schedule. For changes that affect these aspects, %technical scope, cost or schedule the change control process is defined inSections~\ref{sec:dune_changecontrol} and~\ref{sec:tc_change control}.\section{Design}The \dword{dune} design process provides appropriate control of designinputs and design products. The primary design inputs are the\dword{dune} scientific and engineering requirements (e.g., physicsrequirements, detector requirements, specifications, drawings,engineering reports) as discussed inSection~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-requirements}.The basis of the design process requires sound engineering judgmentand practices, adherence to scientific principles, and use ofapplicable orders, codes, and standards. This basis of the designprocess naturally incorporates environment, health, and safetyconcerns.\subsection{Design Process}The \dword{lbnf-dune} Systems Engineering websitedocumentation defines the scope of design work for any givenscientific/engineering work group. From this source, work groupswill begin preliminary design of \dword{dune} by breaking their workdown into sets of engineering drawings, specifications andreports. This is the design output.Throughout the design process, engineers and designers work withconsortium leaders and the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager todetermine \dword{qa} inspection criteria of fabricated products andinstallations. Close coordination must be made with \dword{dune}scientists to assure the engineering satisfies the scientificrequirements of the experiment. Configuration management as documentedin the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{cmp}~\cite{bib:docdb82} will besystematically implemented for \dword{dune}. Final Design work setsthe final \dword{qa} parameters for the parts, assemblies andinstallations. Design during final design and production is confinedto change-controlled changes, as above, and to minor changes necessaryto facilitate production, drawing error correction, materialsubstitutions and similar functional areas.\subsection{Design Verification and Validation}\label{sec:verification}Design is verified and validated to an extent commensurate with itsimportance to safety, complexity of design, degree of standardization,state of the art, and similarity to proven designapproaches. Acceptable verification methods include but are notlimited to any one or a combination of (1) design reviews, (2)alternative calculations, and (3) prototype, qualification testing,and/or (4) comparison of the new design with a similar proven designif available. Verification work must be completed before approval andimplementation of the design.Design reviews will verify and validate that the following criteriaare met at the appropriate milestone:\begin{itemize} \item adherence to requirements, \item technical adequacy of the design, \item adequacy of work instructions, \item thoroughness of specifications, \item test results, \item adequacy of technical reports, \item adequacy of design calculations and drawings, \item reliability and maintainability, and \item calibration program for measurement and test equipment.\end{itemize}The \dword{dune} Review Plan as discussed inChapter~\ref{vl:tc-review} describes the design reviews recommendedfor %its particular consortia.Wherever the design method involves the use ofcomputer software to make engineering calculations or static dynamicmodels of the structure, system, or a component's functionality, thesoftware must be verified to demonstrate that the software producesvalid results. The verification must be documented in a formalreport of validation that is maintained in records that are accessiblefor inspection. However, exemptions may be made for commerciallyavailable software that is widely used and for codes with an extensivehistory of refinement and use by multiple institutions. Exemptionsaffecting systems or components will be identified to the\dword{lbnf-dune} Systems Engineering team.Critical software and firmware computer codes, especially those codesthat are involved in controlling \dword{dune} \dword{daq}, are also subject to reviews for verification andvalidation. Some items to be considered during computer code revieware\begin{itemize}\item adequacy of code testing scheme,\item code release control and configuration management,  \item output data verification against code configuration,  \item verification that code meets applicable standards,   \item verification of code compatibility to other systems that use    the data,  \item verification that code meets applicable hardware requirements,  \item adequacy of code maintenance plans, and  \item adequacy of code and data backup systems.\end{itemize}Validation ensures that any given design product conforms to \dword{dune}requirements.During reviews, validation of conformity to requirementsfollows verification that the engineering design or computer codemeets all criteria. Engineering designs and computer codes arevalidated, preferably before procurement, manufacture, orconstruction; but no later than acceptance and use of the item; thisis to ensure the design or computer code\begin{itemize} \item meets \dword{dune} requirements, \item contains or makes reference to acceptance criteria, and \item identifies all characteristics crucial to the safe and proper   use of the equipment or system and its associated interfaces.\end{itemize}Each inspection, test, or review will feed the \dword{qa} evaluationprocess, which is a comparison of results with acceptance criteria, todetermine acceptance or rejection. Rejection identifies the need forQuality Improvement based on Section~\ref{sec:quality_improvement}. Insome cases, the outcome of the Quality Improvement process may be torequest one or more changes to the design requirements.\dword{qa} reporting formality escalates as the significance of theinspection, test or review nonconformance increases. Higher levels ofmanagement must be aware of and participate in the correction of themost significant nonconformance. Section~\ref{sec:quality_improvement}identifies the required course of action when nonconformance isencountered.\section{Procurement}\subsection{Procurement Controls}Procurement controls will be implemented to ensure thatpurchased items and services meet \dword{dune} requirements and complywith the \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan.  The consortium membersrequesting procurement of items and services are responsible forproviding all documentation that adequately describes the item orservice being procured so that the supplier can understand the requirements for consortium acceptance. Development of this documentationmay be achieved through the involvement of consortium leaders andestablished review and approval systems. The following factors will beconsidered for review and approval of this documentation:\begin{itemize} \item inclusion of technical performance requirements \item identification of required codes and standards, laws and   regulations; \item inclusion of acceptance criteria, including requirements for   receiving inspection and/or source inspection; \item \dword{dune} requirements for vendor qualifications and   certifications; \item \dword{dune} intention to perform acceptance sampling in lieu   of full inspection and test item acceptance.\end{itemize}NOTE: For vendor qualification and acceptance of purchased items ormaterial by consortium members this may be performed under their owninstitution requirements.Previously accepted suppliers will be monitored to ensure that theycontinue supplying acceptable items and services. Source surveillanceis the recommended method to ensure that items are free of damage andthat specified requirements are met. Supplier deliveries will beverified against previously established acceptance criteria.Unacceptable supplier items or services will be documented. Recordsof supplier performance, Inspection Test Records (ITR), andcontract-required submittals, are kept for future procurementconsideration.Inspections will be conducted to detect counterfeit and/or suspectparts. For work funded by \dword{doe}, when counterfeit or suspect partsare found, they will be identified, segregated, and disposed of inaccordance with the \fnal Quality Assurance Manual Chapter 12020Suspect/Counterfeit Items (S/CI) Program. \dword{dune} consortia mayuse their own institutional procedure for counterfeit/suspect parts.\subsection{Inspection and Acceptance Testing}Inspection and testing of electrical, mechanical, and structuralcomponents, and associated services and processes by consortium memberswill be conducted using acceptance and performance criteria. ITRforms, travelers, and a traveler database are the primary tools usedto organize this activity. Inspections will be conducted in accordancewith the graded approach.Once equipment is received at \dword{sdwf}, the equipment is inspected for shipping damage and accuracy against the bill of lading. Consortium members perform any additional inspection and testing that is required by their design documents either at \dword{sdwf} or underground in the clean room as the equipment is prepared for installation.Equipment used for all inspections and tests will be calibrated andmaintained. Calibration will be controlled by a system or systemsmaking appropriate use of qualified calibration serviceproviders. Consortium leaders must ensure that equipment requiringcalibration have their calibration status identified on the item orcontainer, are traceable back to the calibration documentation, and aretracked to ensure the equipment is calibrated at the requiredinterval. The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager oversees and supports the \dword{dune} calibration programs.\section{Assessments}\subsection{Management Assessments}Management assessments may be performed by the consortia or \dword{tc}to evaluate their own management processes (self-assessment) and theirimplementation in order to identify noteworthy practices, uncover issues,identify corrective actions, verify meeting of deliverables, andensure that work being performed is satisfactory and done according to the requirements. The performance of management assessments is a criticalassurance activity.\dword{dune} \dword{tc} will monitor progressof objectives and goals in the consortia to assess whether work isperformed and resources are allocated to meet those objectives andgoals. \dword{dune} \dword{tc}  is responsible for monitoring theresolution of items identified from assessments, assigningresponsibility for resolution, identifying appropriate timeframes forresolution, ensuring actions are finalized with appropriate objectiveevidence, and documented.The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager monitors adequacy ofassessments and progress of corrective actions, and sponsors or conductsperiodic assessments of the effectiveness of implementation of the \dword{qa}program throughout the \dword{dune} project.\subsection{Independent Assessments}The \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} manager will plan reviews asindependent assessments to assist the \dword{dune} \dword{tcoord} inidentifying opportunities for quality or performance-based improvement,and to ensure compliance with specified requirements. Independentassessments of the \dword{dune} projects can be requested by\dword{dune} management. Independent assessments typically focus onquality or \dword{esh} management systems, self-assessment programs, orother organizational functions identified by management. The\dword{dune} project uses a formal process for assigningresponsibility in response to recommendations from independentassessments. These recommendations are tracked to closure.%%%Personnel conducting independent assessments must be technicallyqualified and knowledgeable in the areas assessed. A qualified leadassessor (auditor), who is a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in thetechnical area of assessment, is required. The team may include otherSMEs to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of activities only ifthey are not responsible for the work being assessed.The \fnal directorate appoints an independent Long Baseline NeutrinoCommittee (LBNC) to advise it and \dword{dune} Management. The role ofthis standing committee is described in the \dword{lbnf-dune}project management plan (PMP). The \dword{doe} and other funding agencies perform externalassessments that provide an objective view of performance and thuscontribute to the independent assessment process. Since suchassessments are not under the control of \dword{dune}, they are notnecessarily considered a part of the independent assessmentcriterion. However, \dword{dune} management considers externalassessment results when determining the scope and schedule ofindependent assessments.\section{\dshort{dune} Quality Control}  The \dword{dune} consortia are a geographically diverse group of institutions,collaborating across three continents to fabricate a single integratedsystem. As such, careful planning and control of componentfabrication, assembly and testing must be maintained. Each of themajor system components will be fabricated in accordance withdocumented procedures and drawings.  These procedures will detail theinspection and test requirements for each component to ensure that theymeet the requisite specifications prior shipment to \dword{surf}.Each consortium is responsible for developing the procedures, \dword{qc}plans, and test plans.Required inspections and tests during fabrication and installation aredefined in the consortium \dword{tdr} sections. These inspections and tests maybe performed from receipt of material, during fabrication and finalacceptance. For critical equipment source inspection may be performedin addition. The inspections and tests will be documented on \dword{qc} plans,travelers, test reports, as applicable.  The procedures will definethe documentation method.All data from the fabrication and \dword{qc} processes will be maintained in adatabase that allows the information to be accessed %if neededduring installation. Each consortium will define the requirements forthe information to be stored in the database. The consortium \dword{tdr}sections contain information on how they are utilizing the database.In the case of a nonconformance, the nonconformance will be documentedby the fabrication facility and a recommended disposition will beprovided and forwarded to the consortium technical lead.  If thedisposition is to scrap or rework so that the item meets the requirementsof the specification, the notification to the consortium lead will be %%for information only, and work can continue on performing thedisposition.  If the disposition is ``use as is'' or ``repair'' (where theitem is repaired to meet the functionality but remains innoncompliance with the specification requirements), work on the itemstops until the disposition has been approved by the designauthority, the consortium technical lead and the \dword{tcoord}.  The \dword{tcoord}approves the disposition to ensure it does not affect anyother \dword{dune} components during integration. The item will bere-inspected or tested after completion of the disposition to ensurethat it meets the requirements.\subsection{\dshort{apa} Quality Control}Flatness of the \dword{apa} support frame is a key feature and isdefined as the minimum distance between the two parallel planes that contain all the points on the surface of the \dword{apa}. Afterassembly of the \dword{apa} frame, a laser survey is performed onthe bare frames before  delivery to an \dword{apa}production site. Three sets of data are compiled into a map that showsthe amount of bow, twist, and fold in the frame. A visual file is alsocreated for each \dword{apa} from measured data. During \dword{apa}wiring at the production sites, a final frame survey is completedafter installation of all electrical components, and the as-builtplane-to-plane separations are measured to verify that thedistance between adjacent wire planes meets the tolerances.Another check performed at the \dword{apa} production site before theframe is transferred to a winder is necessary to confirm sufficientelectrical contact between the mesh sub-panels and the \dword{apa}support frame. A resistance measurement is taken immediately aftermesh panel installation for all 20 panels before wiring begins.All components require inspection and \dword{qc} checks before use on an\dword{apa}. Most of these tests will be performed at locations other than the\dword{apa} production sites by institutions within the consortium before thehardware is shipped for use in \dword{apa} construction. This distributedmodel for component production and \dword{qc} is key to enabling the efficientassembly of \dword{apa}s at the production sites. The critical path componentsare the support frames (one per \dword{apa}), grounding mesh panels (20 per\dword{apa}), and wire carrier boards (204 per \dword{apa}).The tension of every wire will be measured during production to ensurethat wires have a low probability of breaking or moving excessively in thedetector. Every channel on the completed \dwords{apa} will also be tested forcontinuity across the \dword{apa} and isolation from other channels.A cold testing facility sized for DUNE \dword{apa}s exists at the Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) at the University of Wisconsin that can beused for such tests. Throughout the construction project, it isanticipated that 10\% of the produced \dwords{apa} will be shipped to PSL forcold cycling. This amounts to about one \dword{apa} per year per production siteduring the project. %It is planned that All \dwords{apa} will still be coldtested during integration at \dword{surf} and before installation in the \dword{spmod}. % DUNE cryostats. All active detector components are shipped to the \dword{sdwf} before final transport to \dword{surf}. During the storage period, the wiretensions are measured on all \dwords{apa} to ensure that the transport hasnot damaged the wires.After unpacking an \dword{apa}, a visual inspection is performed, andwire continuity and tension are measured again. Definiteguidance for the acceptable tension values will be available to informdecisions on the quality of the \dword{apa}. Clear pass/fail criteria will beprovided as well as clear procedures to deal with individual wireslying outside the acceptable values. In addition, a continuity testand a leakage current test is performed on all channels and the datarecorded in the database.\subsection{\dshort{hv} Quality Control}The \dword{hv} consortium has developed a comprehensive \dword{qc}plan for the production, shipping, and installation of the\dword{spmod} \dword{hv} components. Inventory tagging and trackingeach component is crucial. Documentation in the form of printedchecklists is maintained. Travelers will have been replaced by a systemof tags (``cattle tags'') attached to the units with bar codes that key to electronic \dword{qc} data. Power supplies used in a \dword{spmod} are tested beforeinstallation. Output voltages and currents must be checked on a knownload. The feedthrough and filters are tested at the same time,with the planned power supply. The feedthrough must be verified tohold the required voltage in \dword{tpc}-quality \dword{lar} for several days.The \dword{qc} tests of the \dwords{hvdb} %Voltage Divider Boards require that allindividual resistors and varistors are submitted to a warm and cold(87 K) current-voltage measurement. This forms the basis for selectingcomponents that meet specifications; all electrical components mustpass visual inspection for mechanical damage and all measurement values(resistance, clamping voltage) must be within 2$\sigma$ of the mean for theentire sample both in warm and cold tests.The \dword{qc} process for mechanical components starts at the productionfactories by attaching a cattle tag with a unique code to eachproduction element. A file linked to each code contains the individualmeasurements and properties contained in the \dword{qc} checklists for thatelement.\subsection{\dshort{tpc} Electronics Quality Control}All \dwords{asic} will be tested in \dword{ln} before they are mountedon the \dwords{femb}; cryogenic testing of the \dwords{femb} is alsoplanned.  Capacitors and resistors will becryogenically tested on a sample basis of a few components from eachreel. Some other components installed on the \dwords{femb}, e.g., voltage regulators and crystals, will be qualified in \dword{ln}before being mounted on the \dwords{femb}.The \dwords{pcb} for the \dwords{femb} will be tested by thevendor for electrical continuity and shorts. A visual inspection ofthe boards is then performed before installing the discrete componentsand the \dwords{asic}. This inspection is repeated afterinstallation and before the functionality test, which for \dword{dune}will be performed in \dword{ln}.  After assembly, each \dword{femb}is tested in \dword{ln} using the current \dword{cts}.Checks will be performed on all cables during production at roomtemperature, before installation and connection to the\dwords{femb}. These tests  involve continuity and resistancemeasurements on the low voltage power and the bias voltage cables, andbit-error rate measurements on the clock/control and data readoutcables. Connectors will be visually inspected to ensure that they showno sign of damage. Further tests will take place when the \dword{apa}sare tested in the \coldbox{}es at \dword{surf} prior to installationinside the cryostat.On each cryostat penetration there are two flanges for the \dword{ce}and one for the \dword{pd} system. The crossing tubes with their spoolpieces are fabricated by industry and tested by vendors to be leak andpressure proof. The flanges are assembled at consortium institutionsresponsible for the \dword{tpc} electronics and \dword{pd} system; theflanges must undergo both electrical and mechanical tests to ensuretheir functionality. Electrical tests comprise checking all thesignals and voltages to ensure they are passed properly between thetwo sides of the flange and that no shorts exist. Mechanical testsinvolve checking that the flange itself is leak and pressure proof.\subsection{\dshort{pd} Quality Control}Materials certification is required (in the \dword{fnal} materials teststand and other facilities) to ensure materials' compliance withcleanliness requirements. Cryogenic testing of all materials to beimmersed in \dword{lar} is done to ensure satisfactory performance through repeatedand long-term exposure to \dword{lar}. Special attention will be paid tocryogenic behavior of fused silica and plastic materials (such asfilter plates and wavelength-shifters), \dwords{sipm}, cables, andconnectors. Testing will be conducted both on small-scale testassemblies (such as the small test cryostat at Colorado State University (CSU)) and full-scaleprototypes (such as the full-scale CDDF cryostat at CSU). Mechanicalinterface testing, beginning with simple mechanical go/no-go gaugetests, followed by installation into the \dword{pdsp2} system, andfinally full-scale interface testing of the \dword{pd} system into the finalpre-production \dword{tpc} system models will be done; as well as full-system readout tests of the\dword{pd} readout electronics, including trigger generation and timing,and tests for electrical interference between the \dword{tpc} and \dword{pd}signals.Prior to the start of fabrication, a manufacturing and \dword{qc} plan will bedeveloped detailing the key manufacturing, inspection, and teststeps. The fabrication, inspection, and testing of the components willbe performed in accordance with documented procedures. This work willbe documented on travelers and applicable test or inspectionreports. Records of the fabrication, inspection and testing will bemaintained. When a component has been identified as being innoncompliance to the design, the nonconforming condition will bedocumented, evaluated and dispositioned as one of (1) use-as-is (does not meetdesign but can meet functionality as it is), (2) rework (bring intocompliance with design), (3) repair (will be brought to meet functionalitybut will not meet design), or (4) scrap. For products with a dispositionof use-as-is or repair, the nonconformance documentation issubmitted to the design authority for approval. All \dword{qc} data (fromassembly and pre- and post-installation into the \dword{apa}) will be directlystored to the \dword{dune} database for ready access. % of all \dword{qc} data.Monthly summaries of key performance metrics (to be defined) will begenerated and inspected to check for quality trends. Based on the\dword{pdsp} model, we expect to conduct the following productiontesting prior to shipping from assembly site. \begin{itemize}\item dimensional checks ofcritical components and completed assemblies to ensure thatsystem interfaces ar satisfactory;\item  post-assembly cryogenic checkouts of \dword{sipm} mounting\dwords{pcb} (prior to assembly into \dword{pd} modules);\item module dimensionaltolerances using go/no- go gauge set; and \item warm scan of complete moduleusing motor-driven \dword{led} scanner (or UV \dword{led} array).  \end{itemize}Following shippingto the USA reception and checkout facility but prior to storage at\dword{sdwf}, we will conduct mechanical inspection, a warm scan (using identical scanner toinitial scan), and cryogenic testing of completed modules (at the CSU CDDF orsimilar facility).Following delivery to the underground integration cleanroom, prior to andduring integration and Installation, we will \begin{itemize}\item conduct  a warm scan (using identicalscanner to initial scan);\item  complete visual inspection of module againsta standard set of inspection points, with photographic records keptfor each module;\item conduct end-to-end cable continuity and short circuit testsof assembled cables; \item perform a \dword{fe} electronics functionalitycheck  \item perform installation \dword{qc} \dword{pd} system pre-installation testing, following the model established for \dword{pdsp}.\end{itemize}Prior to installation in the \dword{apa}, the \dword{pd} modules will undergo a warmscan in a scanner identical to the one at the \dword{pd} module assemblyfacility and we will compare the results. The module will also undergo a complete visual inspection for defects, and a set ofphotographs of selected critical optical surfaces will be taken and enteredinto the \dword{qc} record database. Following installation into the \dword{apa} andcabling, an immediate check for electrical continuity to the \dwords{sipm}will be conducted. Following the mounting of the \dword{tpc} \dword{ce}and the \dwords{pd}, the entire \dword{apa} will undergo a cold systemtest in a gaseous argon \coldbox, similar to that performed for\dword{pdsp}. During this test and prior to installation, the \dword{pd} system will undergo a finalintegrated system check, checking dark and\dword{led}-stimulated \dword{sipm} performance for all channels, checking forelectrical interference with the \dword{ce}, and confirmingcompliance with the detector grounding scheme.\subsection{Calibration Quality Control}The manufacturer and the institutions in charge of devices willconduct  series of tests to ensure the equipment can perform itsintended function as part of \dword{qc}. \dword{qc}also includes post-fabrication tests and tests run after shipping andinstallation. The overall strategy for the calibration devices is totest the systems for correct and safe operation first in dedicated teststands, then at \dword{pdsp2}, then as appropriate near \dword{surf},and finally underground. Electronics and racks associated with each fullsystem will be tested before transporting them underground. Each calibrationsystem undergoes specific tests.\begin{itemize}\item Ionization Laser System: For assembly and operation of the laser  and feedthrough interface, %this will be   the test is carried out on a mock-up  flange for each of the full hardware sets (periscope, feedthrough,  laser, power supply, and electronics). All operational parts (UV  laser, red alignment laser, trigger photodiode, attenuator,  diaphragm, movement motors, and encoders) are tested for  functionality before being transported underground.\item Photoelectron Laser System: The crucial test is to measure the  light transmission of all fibers at 266 nm. A suitable transmission  acceptance threshold will be established based on studies during the  development phase. Studies to estimate the number of photoelectrons  emitted as a function of intensity (based on distance of fiber  output to the metallic tab) will also be undertaken.\item Laser Beam Location System: For the \dword{lbls}, to ensure uniformity  across all clusters, the main test is to verify    that the PIN diodes are all functional and that their light  detection efficiency is within a specified range. For the mirror-based system, the reflectivity  of all mirrors will  be tested prior to assembly.\item Pulsed Neutron Source System: The first test will be safe  operation of the system in a member institution radiation-safe  facility. Then the system will be validated at \dword{pdsp2}. The  same procedure will be carried out for any subsequent devices before  the devices are transported to \dword{surf} and underground. System  operation will be tested with shielding assembled to confirm safe  operating conditions and sufficient neutron yields using an external  dosimeter as well as with the installed neutron monitor.\end{itemize}\subsection{\dshort{daq} Quality Control}SP-DAQ-6 Data verification: The \dword{daq} must check integrity of data atevery data transfer step. It only deletes data from the localstorage after confirmation that data have been correctly recorded topermanent storage. Data integrity checking is fundamental to ensuredata quality. The high overall experiment uptime goal requires that the \dword{daq} be stringently designed for reliability, fault tolerance, andredundancy  -- criteria that aim to reduce overall downtime. The \dword{daq}monitors the quality of the detector data and of its own operationalstatus, performs automated error detection, and has recoverycapabilities.The \dword{eb} subsystem provides bookkeepingfunctionality for the raw data. This  includes the documenting ofsimple mappings, such as which trigger is stored in which raw datafile, as well as more sophisticated quality checks. For example, itwill know which time windows and geographic regions of the detectorare requested for each trigger, and in the unlikely event that somefraction of the requested detector data cannot be stored in the eventrecord, it will document that mismatch.Data Quality Monitoring: While the \dword{daqccm} contains an element ofmonitoring (Section 7.3.5.4) \fixme{fix}, here \dword{dqm}refers to a subsystem that quickly analyzes the data in order todetermine the general quality of the detector and \dword{daq} operation. This allows operators to promptly detect and respond to anyunexpected changes and assures high exposure times for later physicsanalyses.A \dword{daq} \dword{dqm} will be developed (includingnecessary infrastructure, visualization, and algorithms) that processes a subset of detector data in order to provide prompt feedbackto the detector operators. This system will be designed to allow it toevolve as the detector and its data are understood duringcommissioning and early operation, and to cope with any evolution ofdetector conditions.While the hardware design will be done at the institutions working inthis area, the production of prototypes and final \dwords{pcb} will beoutsourced to companies, allowing for early identification of thosecompanies that can guarantee a high-quality card production.\subsection{\dshort{cisc} Quality Control}The manufacturer and the institution in charge of device assembly willconduct a series of tests to ensure the equipment can perform itsintended function as part of \dword{qc}. \dword{qc} also includes post fabricationtests and tests run after shipping and installation. For complexsystems, the entire system will be tested before shipping. Additional\dword{qc} procedures can be performed underground after installation.The planned tests for each subsystem are described below.\subsubsection{Purity Monitors}The purity monitor system will undergo a series of tests to ensure thesystem performs as intended.  These tests %reflect are based on the \dword{pdsp}purity monitor \dword{qc} tests, which included electronic tests with a pulsegenerator, mechanical and electrical connectivity tests at cryogenictemperatures in a cryostat, and vacuum tests for short and fullassemblies in a dewar and in a long vacuum tube.The \dword{qc} tests for \dword{fd} purity monitors begin with testingindividual purity monitors in vacuum after each is fabricated andassembled. This test checks the amplitude of the signal generated bythe drift electrons at the cathode and the anode to ensure that thephotocathode can provide sufficient numbers of photoelectrons tomeasure the signal attenuation with the required precision, and thatthe field gradient resistors all work properly to maintain the driftfield. A smaller version of the assembly with all purity monitorsinstalled will be tested at the \dword{citf} to ensure the full systemperforms as expected in \dword{lar}.Next, the entire system is assembled on the full-length mounting tubesto check the connections along the way. Ensuring that all electric andoptical connections are operating properly during this test reducesthe risk of problems once the full system is assembled and ready forthe final test in vacuum. The fully assembled system is placed in theshipping tube, which serves as a vacuum chamber, and tested at\dword{surf} before the system is inserted into the cryostat. Duringinsertion, electrical connections are tested continuously withmultimeters and electrometers.\subsubsection{Thermometers}Static T-gradient thermometers: Static T-gradient monitors undergothree type of tests at the production site before shipment to\dword{surf}: a mechanical rigidity test, a calibration of allsensors, and a test of all electrical cables and connectors.The calibration procedure itself provides \dword{qc} because each setof sensors goes through five independent measurements. Sensors with\dword{rms} variation outside the requirement (2 mK for \dword{pdsp}) arediscarded. This calibration also serves as \dword{qc} for the readoutsystem (similar to the final one) and of the \dword{pcb}-sensor-connectorassembly.Finally, the cable-connector assemblies are tested; sensors mustmeasure the expected values with no additional noise introduced byeither cable or connector.An integrated system test is conducted at a \dword{lar} test facilityat the production site, which has sufficient linear dimension ($>$2 m)to test a good portion of the system. This ensures that the systemoperates in \dword{lar} at the required level of performance. Thelaboratory sensor calibration is compared with the in situ calibrationof the dynamic T-gradient monitors by operating both dynamic andstatic T-gradient monitors simultaneously.The last phase of \dword{qc} takes place after installation. Theverticality of each array is checked, and the tensions in thestainless steel strings adjusted as necessary. Before closing theflange, the entire readout chain is tested. This allows a test of thesensor-connector assembly, the cable-connector assemblies at bothends, and the noise level inside the cryostat. If any sensor presentsa problem, it is replaced. If the problem persists, the cable ischecked and replaced as needed.\subsubsection{Dynamic T-gradient thermometers}Before installation, temperature sensors are tested in \dword{ln} toverify correct operation and to set the baseline calibration for eachsensor with respect to the absolutely calibrated reference sensor.Warm and cold temperature readings are taken with each sensor after itis mounted on the \dword{pcb} board and the readout cables are soldered.  Thesensor readout is taken for all sensors after the cold cables areconnected to electric feedthroughs on the flange and the warm cablesoutside of the cryostat are connected to the temperature readoutsystem.The fully assembled rod is connected to the pinion and gear, and movedwith the stepper motor on a high platform many times to verifyrepeatability, possible offsets, and any uncertainty in thepositioning. Finally, repeating this test so many times will verifythe sturdiness of the system.The full system is tested after it is installed in the cryostat; bothmotion and sensor operation are tested by checking sensor readout andvertical motion of the system.To address the quality of individual precision sensors, the samemethod as for the static T-gradient monitors is used. The \dword{qc}of the sensors is part of the laboratory calibration.After mounting six sensors with their corresponding cables, a SUBD-25connector is added, and the six sensors are tested at roomtemperature. All sensors must give values within specifications.\subsubsection{Gas Analyzers}The gas analyzer modules are checked for both zero and the span valuesusing a gas-mixing instrument and two gas cylinders, one having a zerolevel of the gas analyzer contaminant species and the other %cylinderhaving a known percentage of the contaminant gas. This verifies theproper operation of the gas analyzers. When they are installed at\dword{surf}, this process is repeated prior to commissioning the cryostat cryogenics systems.\subsubsection{Liquid Level Monitoring}The manufacturer will provide the \dword{qc} for the differential pressurelevel meters. The capacitive sensors will be tested with a modestsample of \dword{lar} in the laboratory before  installation. Afterinstallation, they are tested in situ using a suitable dielectric incontact with the sensor.\subsubsection{Pressure Meters}The manufacturer will provide the \dword{qc} for the pressure meters.The pressure sensors will be tested with a modest sample of gaseousargon in the laboratory before they are installed. After installation,they are tested in situ at atmospheric pressure. The whole pressurereadout chain, (including slow controls PLC and WINCC conversion) willalso be tested and cross-checked with \dword{lbnf} pressure sensors.\subsubsection{Cameras}Before transport to \dword{surf}, each cryogenic camera unit(comprising the enclosure, camera, and internal thermal control andmonitoring) is checked for correct operation of all features, forrecovery from 87K non-operating mode, for leakage, and for physicaldefects. Lighting systems are similarly checked. Operations tests willverify correct current draw, image quality, and temperature readbackand control. The movable inspection camera apparatus is inspected forphysical defects and checked for proper mechanical operation beforeshipping. A checklist is created for each unit, filed electronicallyin the \dword{dune} logbook, and a hard copy is sent with each unit.Before installation, each fixed cryogenic camera unit is inspected forphysical damage or defects and checked at the \dword{citf} for correctoperation of all features, for recovery from 87K non-operating mode,and for contamination of the \dword{lar}. Lighting systems are similarlychecked. Operations tests verify correct current draw, image quality,and temperature readback and control.After installation and connection of wiring, fixed cameras andlighting are again checked for operation.  The movable inspectioncamera apparatus is inspected for physical defects and, afterintegration with a camera unit, tested in the facility for propermechanical and electronic operation and cleanliness before beinginstalled or stored. A checklist is completed for each \dword{qc} checkand filed electronically in the \dword{dune} logbook.\subsubsection{\dshort{led} System}The entire \dword{led} system is checked before installation to ensurefunctionality of light emission. Initial testing of the system beginswith measuring the current when low voltage (1~V) is applied, to checkthat the resistive \dword{led} failover path is correct. Next, theforward voltage is measured using nominal forward current to checkthat it is within 10\% of the nominal forward voltage drop of the\dword{led}, that all of the \dwords{led} are illuminated, and thateach \dword{led} is visible over the nominal angular range. If the\dwords{led} are infrared, a video camera with the IR filter removedis used for a visual check.This procedure is then duplicated with the current reversed for\dwords{led} oriented in the opposite direction. Initial tests areperformed at room temperature and then repeated in \dword{ln}. Colorshifts in the \dwords{led} are expected and will be noted. A checklistis completed for each \dword{qc} check and filed electronically in theDUNE logbook.Room temperature tests are repeated during and immediately afterinstallation to ensure that the system has not been damaged duringtransportation or installation. Functionality checks of the\dwords{led} are repeated after the cameras are installed in thecryostat.Slow Controls Hardware Networking and computing systems will bepurchased commercially, requiring \dword{qc}. However, the new serversare tested after delivery to confirm they suffered no damage duringshipping. The new system is allowed to burn in overnight or for a fewdays, running a diagnostics suite on a loop in order to validate themanufacturer's \dword{qa} process.\section{ProtoDUNE to DUNE QA Approach}The approach to \dfirst{qa}/\dfirst{qc} for \dword{dune} is going to bevery similar to the activities and oversight that was performed for\dword{protodune}.  For \dword{protodune}, the major\dword{qa}/\dword{qc} activities included review of the consortium\dword{tdr} \dword{qa}/\dword{qc} sections; assisting the consortia indevelopment and review of \dword{qc} plans (production andinstallation), fabrication, inspection and test procedures,installation plans and documentation; and the performance of\dwords{prr} at eleven consortium fabrication facilities.  There wasalso \dword{qc} participation in the \dword{protodune} design reviews.The \dwords{prr} looked at the following criteria:\begin{itemize}  \item final \dword{qa} plans for institutions not adopting the    \dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} Plan;  \item final production drawings, specifications, and manufacturing    and test procedures;  \item final safety documents (i.e., hazard analysis documentation);  \item component \dword{qc} plan (i.e., travelers, test reports,    software verification and validation documents, supplier    documentation);  \item final procurement documents per institution practice; and  \item completion and evaluation of prototypes, and review of production    process and \dword{qc} results.\end{itemize}The reviews ensured the facilitieswere prepared for production and that any kinks in the processes had beenidentified and mitigations performed. %have taken place. The positive outcome ofthese reviews was the amount of equipment received at \dword{cern} with littleto no damage.\dwords{ppr} will be performed at the fabrication facilities for the\dword{dune} detector components. This type of review has been added due to thelarger number of components required and the increased number offabrication facilities. The goal of these reviews is to ensureconsistent fabrication processes between the facilities. If an issueis identified at one facility, it can be communicated to %the other applicable facilities others to prevent recurrence. %the same issue occurring.For \dword{protodune}, installation was performed at \dword{cern} under theguidance of \dword{cern} policies and procedures. Installation of the\dword{dune} \dwords{detmodule} at \dword{surf} will fall under similar procedures in the\dword{lbnf-dune} \dword{qa} plan.

Some common design considerations for calibration devices include stability, reliability, and longevity, so calibration systems can be operated for the lifetime of the experiment (\dunelifetime). Such longevity is uncommon for any device, so the overall design permits replacing devices where possible, namely the parts that are external to the cryostat. The systems must also adhere to relevant global requirements of the \dword{dune} detector. Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-CALIB} shows the top-level overall requirements for calibration subsystems along with global \dword{dune} requirements that are relevant for calibration. For example, \dword{dune} requires the \efield  on any instrumentation device inside the cryostat to be less than 30 kV/cm to minimize the risk of dielectric breakdown in \dword{lar}. Another consideration important for event reconstruction is understanding the maximum tolerable level of noise on the readout electronics due to calibration devices and implementing proper grounding schemes to minimize it. 
%Another consideration important for reconstructing events is the maximum noise level the readout electronics can tolerate from calibration devices \todo{Jose to check the next part of the sentence} and implementing proper grounding scheme to minimize noise issues. 
\dword{pdsp} is evaluating this. In Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-CALIB}, two values are quoted for most of the parameters: 1) specification, which is the minimum requirement to guarantee baseline performance, and 2) goal, an ideal requirement %enabling more detailed studies and 
for achieving improved precision.

For the ionization laser system, the energy and position reconstruction requirements for physics measurements lead to requirements for the necessary precision in measuring the \dword{tpc} \efield as well as its spatial coverage and granularity. The precision of the \efield measurement with the laser system must be about \SI{1}{\%} so that the effect from \efield on the collected charge, via the dependence of the recombination factor on \efield, is well below \SI{1}{\%}. This is also motivated by consistency with the high level \dword{dune} specification of \SI{1}{\%} on field uniformity throughout the volume for component alignment and the \dword{hv} system. For laser coverage, to keep the \efield measurement at the $\sim$\SI{1}{\%} level, we are aiming for a coverage of \SI{75}{\%} or more of the total \dword{fv}. The requirement on granularity for the laser is estimated based on the \dword{fv} uncertainty requirements (\SI{1}{\%}) and corresponding uncertainty requirements (\SI{1.5}{\cm}) in each coordinate. A specification is set for a voxel size of \num{30}$\times$\num{30}$\times$\SI{30}{\cubic\cm}, that should be sufficient to satisfy the \dword{fv} uncertainty requirements. A goal is set for \num{10}$\times$\num{10}$\times$\SI{10}{\cubic\cm}, which could allow for a refinement in precision in some detector regions. 

The laser beam location must also meet the level of reconstruction requirement in each coordinate, approximately \SI{5}{\milli\m}. In order to reach that over distances of up to \SI{20}{\m}, where the latter is the maximum distance that any beam needs to travel to cover all detector voxels, this results in a stringent alignment requirement of \ang{0.015} (or \SI{0.25}{\mrad}) on the pointing precision. The laser beam location system is also designed to check the beam location with a precision of \SI{5}{\milli\m} over distances of up \SI{20}{\m}.
%\SI{5}{\milli\m} over \num{5} to \SI{10}{\m}, where the latter is the distance between two consecutive laser ports in the beam direction. This results in a stringent requirement of \ang{0.03} (or \SI{0.5}{\mrad}).
The data volume for the ionization laser system must be %at least 
no more than \num{184}~TB/year/\SI{10}{\kt}, assuming \num{800}k laser pulses, \num{10}$\times$\num{10}$\times$\SI{10}{\cubic\cm} voxel sizes, a \SI{100}{\micro\s} zero suppression window, and two dedicated calibration campaigns per year.

For the \dword{pns} system, the system must provide sufficient neutron event rate to make spatially separated precision measurements across the detector of a comparable size to the voxels probed by the laser (\num{30}$\times$\num{30}$\times$\SI{30}{\cubic\cm}) for most regions of the detector (\SI{75}{\%}). 
%The laser and \dword{pns} systems are probing different detector and response parameters, so using one system to propagate the other's calibration to the rest of the detector is not possible.
% 1st draft
%For the supernova program, measurements from the \dword{pns} \fixme{This abbreviation is in neither glossary.} should demonstrate 1\% energy scale, 5\% energy resolution, and 0.5 MeV detection threshold, so each voxel should have sufficient neutron event rate to achieve this. %\todo{KM: Improve or remind connection to SN program? even though it's comparable? SG: maybe for 2nd draft?}
%rewritten for 2nd draft
For the \dword{snb} program, the sensitivity to distortions of the neutrino energy spectrum depends on the uncertainties in the detection threshold and the reconstructed energy scale and resolution. Studies discussed in the physics \dword{tdr} present target ranges for the uncertainties in these parameters~\cite{bib:docdb14068} as a function of energy. The measurements with the \dword{pns} system aim to provide response corrections and performance estimates, so those uncertainty targets are met throughout the whole volume. This ensures that each voxel has sufficient neutron event rate (percent level statistical uncertainty).

In terms of data volume requirements, the \dword{pns} system requires at least \num{144}~TB/year/\SI{10}{\kt} assuming \num{e5} neutrons/pulse, \num{100} neutron captures/\si{\cubic\m},
%m$^{3}$ 
and \num{130} observed neutron captures per pulse, and two calibration runs per year. 

Table~\ref{tab:fdgen-calib-all-reqs} shows the full set of requirements related to all calibration subsystems. More details on each of the requirements can be found under dedicated subsections.

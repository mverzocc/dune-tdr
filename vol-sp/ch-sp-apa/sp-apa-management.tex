\section{Organization and Management}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org}

Coordination of the groups participating in the \dword{dune} \dword{apa} Consortium is critical to successfully executing the large-scale multi-year construction project that is needed to produce high-quality \dword{apa}s for the \dword{dune} \dwords{spmod}.   The \dword{apa} consortium comprises \num{21} institutions, of which \num{14} are in the USA and \num{7} in the UK (see Table~\ref{tab:apa-institutions}). The consortium is organized along the main deliverables, which are the final design of the \dword{apa} and the \dword{apa} production and installation procedures (see Figure~\ref{fig:apa-consortium-structure}).  The two main centers of \dword{apa} construction are in the USA and the UK, so usually the leaders of a working group are chosen to represent the main stakeholders to ensure that common procedures and tooling are developed.  We plan to produce half of the \dword{dune} \dwords{apa}s in the USA and half in the UK.

%\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
%\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-assmp}

%The planning assumes nine \dword{apa} assembly lines at different locations in the UK and the USA.  We assume set up time for the factories will take about one year. It will take approximately \num{40} shifts (8 hours) of clock time  to construct a single \dword{apa}. Assuming an 8 hours shift/day, we can construct the \num{150} \dwords{apa} required for one \dword{spmod} %\SI{10}{kton} module within about two and a half years.

%\subsection{WBS and Responsibilities}
%\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-wbs}

%Here, we only discuss the top-level WBS elements: (1)~design, engineering and prototypes, (2)~production setup, (3)~production, (4)~integration and installation.

The university groups and \dword{bnl} are responsible for validating  the design, while engineering and the production set up is being developed at PSL %at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
(USA) and Daresbury Laboratory (UK), where the \dwords{apa} for \dword{pdsp} have been built. 
%with contributions from university groups. \fixme{Nora: I think what you mean here is that the university groups will contribute to developing the engineering and production set up. To make that clear, you likely will need another sentence instead of "with contributions from university groups". So "The university groups will contribute to developing..."} 
In addition to PSL and Daresbury Laboratory, the University of Chicago and Yale University are developing detailed plans for the layouts, activities, and schedule at each site. 
%The production sites will require significant help from university groups during the production process. 

In addition to the \dword{apa} production sites, a successful production effort will require significant and sustained contributions from university groups throughout the production process.  Table~\ref{tab:apa-institution-roles} and Figure~\ref{fig:apa-construction-org} list the main work packages that are part of the overall \dword{apa} construction process and the institutions in the USA and UK who are taking the leading roles in each effort.  The tasks range from the production of bare support frames, to the assembly and testing of many thousands of wire boards, to the procurement of the custom transport crates for shipping the completed \dword{apa}s.  The on-time supply of materials to each of the \dword{apa} production sites will be imperative to maintaining the production schedule, and detailed plans are being developed for the execution of the project in both countries. 

%In addition to a project management team to oversee operations across the project, all work packages have an identified faculty lead. 

%The steel for the frames most likely will be bought from a single vendor but will be assembled in the USA and the UK separately. We are still exploring the option to assemble the frames in house or in collaboration with industrial partners. Other significant components include on-\dword{apa} electronics boards. Design modifications for \dword{pdsp} are the responsibility of PSL, University of Wisconsin-Madison. The boards will be produced by industry partners, but the testing will be distributed among consortium institutions. The shipping of the \dwords{apa} is the responsibility of the production factories in the USA and the UK, while the design of the \dword{apa} transport frame is responsibility of the UK groups. The integration and installation are a joint responsibility of the consortium, with UK taking a leading role for integration and US for installation. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) is cooperating with the technical coordination group for the design of the \dword{apa} support system within the cryostat.

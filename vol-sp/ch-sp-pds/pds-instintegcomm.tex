A storage facility near or at the \dword{fd} site (the \dword{sdwf}) will be established to allow storage of materials for detector assembly until needed.  Transport of assembled and tested PD modules, electronics, cabling, and monitoring hardware to the \dword{sdwf} is the responsibility of the \dword{pd} consortium.

Following assembly and quality management testing in Brazil, the \dword{pd} modules  will be packaged and shipped to an intermediate testing facility in the US for post-shipping checkout. Following this, the modules will be stored in their shipping containers in the \dword{sdwf}.  Cables, readout electronics, and monitoring hardware will be shipped directly to the \dword{sdwf} and stored until needed underground for integration.

Packaging plans are informed by the \dword{pdsp} experience.  Each \dword{sp} module will be individually sealed into a light-tight anti-static plastic bag.  Bagged modules will be packaged in groups of ten modules (matching the need for a single \dword{apa} transported in a single shipping box), approximately \SI{20}{cm} $\times$ \SI{20}{cm} $\times$ \SI{250}{cm} long.  These shipping boxes will be gathered into larger crates to facilitate shipping.  The optimal number per shipment is being considered.

Documentation and tracking of all components and \dword{pd} modules will be required during the full logistics process. Well defined procedures are in place to ensure that all components/modules are tested and examined prior to, and after, shipping. Information coming from such testing and examinations will be stored in the \dword{dune} hardware database.  Each \dword{pd} module shipping bag will be labeled with a text and barcode label, referencing the unique ID number for the module contained, and allowing linkage to the hardware database upon unpacking prior to integration into the APAs underground.

Tests have been conducted and continue to validate environmental requirements for photon detector handling and shipping. The environmental condition specifications for lighting (SP-PDS-3 in Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS}), humidity (SP-PDS-4 in Table~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS}), and work area cleanliness (SP-PDS-1 in Table ~\ref{tab:specs:SP-PDS})
apply for surface and underground transport, storage and handling, and any exposure during installation and integration underground. 


Details of \dword{pd} integration into the \dword{apa} and installation into the cryostat, including quality management testing equipment, tests, and documentation are included in \spchinstall{}, Detector Installation.

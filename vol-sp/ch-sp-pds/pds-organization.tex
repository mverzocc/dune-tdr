The \single \dword{pds} consortium follows the typical organizational structure of DUNE consortia:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Consortium Lead provides overall leadership for the effort and attends meetings of the DUNE Executive and Technical Boards.
\item A Technical Lead provides technical support to the consortium lead, attends the Technical Board and other project meetings, oversees the project schedule and \dword{wbs}, and oversees the operation of the project working groups.  
\item A Project Management Board composed by the project leads from the participating countries, the consortium leadership team and few ad-hoc members, which maintains tight communication between the countries participating in the consortium construction activity.
%In the case of the \dword{pds}, the technical lead is supported by a deputy technical lead.
\end{itemize}


Below the leadership, the consortium is divided up into six working groups, each led by two or three working group conveners (see Table~\ref{tbl:pds-wgs}).  Each working group is charged with one primary area of responsibility within the consortium, and the conveners report directly to the Technical Lead regarding those responsibilities.

\begin{dunetable}[\dshort{pd} Working Groups]

Physics and Simulation WG & Physics and simulations studies to determine \dword{pd} specifications\\ \colhline
ProtoDUNE Analysis WG & Validation of PD system in \dshort{pdsp} and \dshort{pdsp2}\\
\end{dunetable}

The working group conveners are appointed by the \dword{pds} Consortium Lead and Technical Lead; the structure may evolve as the consortium matures and additional needs are identified.

\subsection{High-Level Schedule}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-org-cs}

Table \ref{tab:Xsched} lists key milestones in the design, validation, construction, and installation of the single-phase photon detector system.  These milestones include external milestones indicating linkages to the main DUNE schedule (highlighted in color in the table), as well as internal milestones such as design validation and technical reviews.

In general, the flow of the schedule commences with a 60\% design review based on module performance testing at \dword{unicamp} and at \dword{iceberg} and integration testing at Ash River.  Additional similar design validation follows, leading to a final design review (FDR).  Following the FDR, 30 modules and required electronics, cabling, and \dword{pd} monitoring system components for \dword{pdsp2} will be built, installed, and validated during a second ProtoDUNE run at \dword{cern}.  Once the data from this test have undergone initial analysis, production readiness reviews will be conducted and module fabrication will begin.

Some parts of the \dword{pds} system, such as the support rails and electrical connectors required in mid-2020 for \dword{apa} assembly and photosensors and filter plates which have a long procurement cycle, will require an abbreviated design review process as detailed in the narrative earlier in this document and shown in the milestone table.

\subsection{High-Level Cost Narrative}

In the fall of 2018, we completed an initial cost estimate for fabrication of \dword{pd} modules for one \SI{10}{kt} \dword{dune} module and updated the estimate extensively in March/April of 2019.  The estimates are based on \dword{pdsp} costs, modified as necessary for an \dword{xarapu} design.  Vendor quotations or vendor estimates are used for all the major components. %The biggest uncertainties in fabrication costs center around the photosensor fabrication, that constitute approximately half the total PD system cost.  
For fabrication costs, the biggest uncertainties center around the photosensor fabrication; this constitutes approximately half the total PD system cost.
We have estimates from Hamamatsu for photosensors which would reduce this line by nearly a factor of two, significantly reducing the system cost.  We also have preliminary indications that similar cost savings may also be available from using \dword{fbk} photosensors.  As noted earlier in this \dword{tdr}, a major focus of our remaining development work is focused on realizing these potential savings.

The dichroic filter procurement and coating represent the other major cost driver for the project.  The costing for the filter plates is based on initial contacts with a Brazilian filter firm.  Initial samples of filter substrates have been received at \dword{unicamp} and have been successfully coated and tested through multiple cryogenic cycles with no indication of failure. Extensive additional validation of the Brazilian filters  will occur during late 2019 as part of the SBND module fabrication.

These filter plates are significantly cheaper than the filters manufactured by Omega, Inc. that were tested in our earlier validation studies.  Until these tests are complete, the filter plates remain a significant cost and schedule risk.

Extensive use of design-for-fabrication techniques throughout the module development phase, as well as multiple rounds of prototype development, have allowed us to minimize the component cost for the remaining components.  In-house fabrication and assembly using university shop facilities and student labor for assembly (particularly at \dword{unicamp}) have also reduced costs.

Modification of an existing and well understood readout electronics system has very significantly reduced initial cost estimates for that portion of the system.

#+title: The DUNE TDR repository

* Autobuilt PDFs

Every working commit pushed to this repository on GitHub may trigger
an automated build of the LaTeX source into PDFs.  The output of this
automated process will refresh files found here:

https://dune.bnl.gov/docs/dune-tdr/

Please register a working email address with GitHub if you wish to get
notification of build failures due to problems in your commits.
Notification is not sent in the case of successful commits.

* Repository layout

- All graphics files (JPEG, PNG, PDF) go under [[./graphics/]].  Use
  simple file name with out any directory path regardless of the
  location of ~.tex~ file.  E.g.,: ~\includegraphics{filename}~.

- The LaTeX content of each volume is under its own directory, e.g.,
  [[./vol-exec/]] except for the volume's main LaTeX file which is
  at top-level, e.g., [[./vol-exec.tex]]

- Likewise, each chapter of a volume has a LaTeX file in the volume
  directory, e.g., [[./vol-exec/ch-exec-overall.tex]].

- Chapter editors are encouraged to retain one file per chapter but if
  they must be broken up the chapter file must remain and other
  section-level files should NOT be named with a "ch-" prefix.
  It is not required but section files can remain in the ~vol-*/~
  directory or be moved to a ~ch-*/~ sub-directory.

- The [[common/]] directory holds important LaTeX files such as [[./common/defs.tex][defs.tex]],
  [[./common/units.tex][units.tex]], [[common/glossary.tex][glossary.tex]] and [[common/tdr-citedb.bib][tdr-citedb.bib]] which authors and editors
  should familiarize themselves with and contribute to.

- [[shared/]] holds special case LaTeX content that must appear
  identically in more than one volume.  

- [[util/]] holds some scripts that assist in building the document in
  particular for generating files.

- [[generated/]] holds some the automatically generated files.
  Human-edited files *must not* be placed in this directory.
  See section [[Generated files]] below for some details.

* Building the documents

There are many ways to do this.  

** Official build

The full, official build method uses the provided ~waf~ command.  It
is fast, portable and performs many tasks.  Primarily the volume PDF
files are built with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf configure
  $ ./waf
#+END_EXAMPLE

The final PDFs are under ~build/~.  So are all the intermediate files.
To clean out you can do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf clean
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you want to keep the final build results safe from a ~clean~ then
you ~install~ them somewhere.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf configure --prefix=/path/to/some/install/location
  $ ./waf install
#+END_EXAMPLE

In addition to the volume PDF you can generate and build per-chapter PDFs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --chapters
#+END_EXAMPLE

For a specific chapter compliation, e.g. dune-tdr/vol-sp/ch-sp-hv.tex, while in dune-tdr/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --chapters --targets=vol-sp-ch-sp-hv.tex,vol-sp-ch-sp-hv.pdf
#+END_EXAMPLE

The results are under ~build/~ but may also be installed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --chapters install 
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can also prepare a tar file with just the files for each volume.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./waf --arxiv
#+END_EXAMPLE



* Generated files

In volume/chapter text you may ~\input{}~ various files that live under
the [[./generated/]] directory.  The files are named following certain
patterns. 

** Requirements/specification tables

Requirements tables in various forms are made available.  They are
organized by a table type and by a "code name" which is associated to
a spreadsheet in DocDB via this file [[./util/dune-reqs-docids.txt]].
The "top level" specs have a code name like ~SP-FD~.
Some examples:

- ~req-longtable-<code>.tex~ :: the "top 5" + "selected top level" +
     "consortium level".  

- ~req-just-<code>.tex~ :: just the "consortium level".

- ~req-<code>-<label>.tex~ :: a table holding a single requirement
     identified by its label and consoritum "code name".

- ~req-<code>-<NN>.tex~ :: a single table row if one wants to construct
     the table manually in the body of the volume/chapter text.

The \dword{pds} has several interfaces with other subsystems and the global \dword{dune} systems. The interface documents related to \dword{dp} \dword{pds} are given in Table~\ref{tab:dppd_t_8}. %Only some 
A few of the basic interfaces are summarized below.

\begin{itemize}

\item \dword{dp} Electronics: The \dword{pds} shares the same \dword{fe} electronics standard as the charge readout, which is \dword{utca}-based \cite{utca}. The \dword{dp} electronics will provide data in continuous streaming %(\num{12} bits at \SI{2.5}{\MHz} sampling) 
from all \dword{pds} channels over the \SI{10}{\Gbps} links. The number of \dwords{pmt}%photomultipliers 
to be read out is \dpnumpmtch, to be distributed among \num{60} \dword{amc} cards (\num{20} \dword{utca} crates for the \num{20} \dword{pds} sectors, \num{36} readout channels in \num{3} \dword{amc} cards per crate). Readout racks for the sectors will be \SI{6}{\m} apart along the \SI{60}{\m} side and on both sides. Deeper understanding of \dword{pmt} characteristics
 (e.g., saturation, recovery time, ringing, pre- and after-pulsing) will be provided by \dword{dp} \dword{pds}. The type of connectors used at the \dword{fe} input panel will be determined by the \dword{dp} electronics consortium and will be implemented by \dword{dp} \dword{pds}.

\item \dword{hv}: This interface includes consideration of the distance between the cathode/\dword{gg} and the \dword{pmt} planes, the installation of the reflector/\dword{wls} panel assemblies on the inner surface of the \dword{fc}, and the possible implementation of the \dword{gg} at the individual \dword{pmt} level. The \dword{hv} consortium and \dword{pds} consortium will be communicating to harmonize the underground installation.

\item \dword{daq}: The hardware interface uses mainly optical fibers. \dword{dp} \dword{pds} provides trigger and data in continuous streaming;  the interface also includes the \dword{daq} software.

\item \dword{cisc}: The main interface points with the \dword{cisc} are the layout of the cryogenics instrumentation (e.g., purity monitors, temperature sensors, and light emitting system for the cameras) and the \dword{pmt} support structures and cabling, as well as the slow control of the \dword{pds} power supplies and calibration system. The \dword{pds} \dwords{pmt} are part of \num{20} sectors with \num{36} \dwords{pmt} each, and will be controlled with \num{20} \dword{hv} crates.

\item \dune Physics: \dual \dword{pds} has interfaces with the overall physics requirements on energy and time, as well as classification of events, decay modes, and neutrino flavors.

\item Software and Computing: This interface involves developing the simulation, reconstruction, and analysis tools.

\item Calibration: The \dword{pds} participates in the \dword{dune} global calibration task force and will provide handles to allow global monitoring of \dword{pmt} performance.

\item Detector and Facilities (\dword{lbnf}) infrastructure: The \dword{pds}
\dword{pmt} supporting base on the cryostat floor, cold cables and cable trays, and the feedthroughs are the major interfaces with the facility. The facility is responsible for the cable trays that run from the ceiling \fdth flanges to the bottom of the cryostat, through which the cables and calibration fibers are routed. \fixme{check my edit. anne} Installing the \dwords{pmt} and connecting the fibers and \dword{hv}/signal cables to the \dwords{pmt} are responsibilities of \dword{pds}. Other interfaces with the facility include access to conventional facilities and participation in the \dword{ddss}.

\item \Dword{uit}: This interface with the \dword{uit} includes the transportation of \dword{pds} components to and between underground areas, cleanroom activities, storage, and coordination of the installation with the other teams. The details are described in Section~\ref{subsec:dp-pds-undergroundinstallation}.

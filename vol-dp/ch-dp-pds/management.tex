\section{Project Management}
\label{sec:dp-pds-management}

The  \dword{dp} \dword{pds} consortium was formed in 2017;  it comprises eleven institutions from France, Peru, Spain, UK, and USA, and is charged %. The charge of the \dword{dp} \dword{pds} consortium is to 
with planning and executing the construction, installation, and commissioning of the  \dword{dp} \dword{pds}.
% I think we should check with Peru and UK if they are still interested in being included in the consortium

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Consortium Organization}

The current \dword{dp} \dword{pds} consortium leader is %In\'{e}s Gil-Botella
 from CIEMAT (Spain) and the technical lead is %Dominique Duchesneau 
 from LAPP (France). They are members of the \dword{dune} technical board and represent the consortium in the overall \dword{dune} collaboration. The consortium leader is responsible for the subsystem deliverables and for effectively managing the consortium. The technical lead acts as the overall project manager and is the interface to the international project office; this person is responsible for monitoring and reporting on progress according to the agreed-upon schedule, and for interface documentation.

The institutions participating in the consortium are responsible for the design and/or construction of a particular subsystem. The national groups within the consortium plan to approach relevant funding agencies with a specific construction-phase proposal to obtain a likely funding line in 2019. The \dword{dp} \dword{pds} consortium %is open to any 
welcomes new institutions willing to join the current effort.

The current participating institutions %in the \dual \dword{pd} consortium 
are listed in Table \ref{tab:dppd_instit}.

The % \dual \dword{pd} 
consortium is divided into four working groups: photosensors and electronics, calibration system, mechanics and integration, and simulation and physics. The corresponding current working group convener institutions are
\begin{itemize}
% AH REMOVING NAMES
\item WG1: Photosensors and Electronics -  CIEMAT, %A. Verdugo
\item WG2: Calibration System -  CIEMAT, %C. Cuesta

\item WG4: Simulation and Physics - %K. Scholberg (

LAPP.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{sec:fddp-pd-12.2}

The baseline design of the \dword{dp} \dword{pds} is a complex optimization based on the results from and experience with the first metric-ton-scale \dword{dp} \dword{lartpc} %demonstrator 
(\dword{wa105}), critical evaluation of the design and construction of this demonstrator and \dword{pddp}, physics objectives of the \dword{dune} experiment, and the detailed simulation studies of the \dword{dpmod} as well as \dword{wa105} and \dword{pddp}.

The previous design and construction of the \dword{dp} modules have enabled us to critically evaluate several scenarios and develop the \dword{dpmod} \dword{pds} design optimized for maximum physics performance; simple construction, transportation, handling, and installation; and easy and robust operation.

Simulations are effectively used in designing and optimizing this \dword{pds}  to meet the physics requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item light collection efficiency,
\item number of channels,
\item photosensor requirements,
\item dynamic range of readout electronics and timing resolution, and 
\item trigger strategy on non-beam events.
\end{itemize}

Although no major design modifications are foreseen, the \dword{pddp} operations will be closely monitored to fine-tune the \dword{dpmod} design. The baseline design will be validated with \dword{pddp} data in March \num{2020}. The final components of the system will be installed, tested and validated during the second \dword{pddp} run at \dword{cern} in March \num{2023}. Internal design reviews will be conducted after accomplishing these milestones.

\subsection{Work Breakdown Structure and Institutional Responsibilities}

The \dword{dp} \dword{pds} consortium has developed a detailed breakdown of deliverables and responsibilities \citedocdb{5606} included in the overall \dword{dune} collaboration \dword{wbs} \citedocdb{5594}%\cite{bib:docdb5594} 
coordinated by the international project office. The main deliverables are %based on the \dword{pddp} \dword{pds}  and are 
divided into seven topics:

\chapter{Detector installation}
\label{ch:dp-installation}

This chapter covers the work and the infrastructure required to install the \dword{dune} \dword{dp} \dword{fd} module.
The infrastructure and the installation sequence have been defined assuming that the cryostat of the \dword{dpmod} is installed in an empty cavern.
This allows for more flexible installation of the needed infrastructure.
If the \dword{dpmod} is the third module installed, a different installation procedure and infrastructure should be defined.
This is out of the scope of this chapter.

A \dword{dune} \dword{fd} module has outer cryostat dimensions of $65.8 \times 18.9 \times 17.8$~m$^3$.
Every piece of the cryostats and the detectors must descend about 1500~m down the Ross shaft to the 4850-foot level of \dword{surf} and be transported to the detector cavern.
The installation of the detector is done in close collaboration with \dword{lbnf}, that is in charge of  excavating the caverns and providing the cryostats for all the \dword{dune} modules.

Inside the cryostat the \dword{dp} detector consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item 80 $3 \times 3$~m$^2$ \dwords{crp} installed across the liquid/vapour argon interface.
\item  12 $12 \times 12$~m$^2$ \dword{fc} modules installed vertically along the walls.
\item  15 cathode modules  installed parallel to the \dwords{crp} and hanging from the bottom of the \dword{fc}.
\item  720 \dwords{pmt} installed on the cryostat floor under the cathode and a protection ground grid.
\item  A set of instruments to optimally operate the \dword{tpc} (purity monitors, temperature sensors, level meters, cryogenic cameras).
\end{itemize}

Compared to the \dword{spmod}, the installation of the \dword{dpmod} is significantly simpler inside the cryostat and it requires less complex infrastructure.
The sequence of installation is driven by the tests of the \dwords{crp}.
The work on the \dword{dpmod} can profit from all the infrastructure already in place for the installation on the \dword{spmod}, like the \dword{cuc}, the underground mechanical workshop, the storage facility, the logistic, and so on.

Some of the detector components arrive at \dword{surf} fully/mostly assembled, like the \dwords{crp}.
Others are mostly assembled underground, like the field cage modules.
The majority of the activities happen in a clean room, set up in front of the \dword{tco} entrance and inside the cryostat.
The clean room is equipped with four cold boxes where the \dwords{crp} go through the final cryogenic and HV tests.

After about twelve months of detector component installation, which follows twelve months of detector infrastructure installation, the cryostat is closed (with the last installation steps occurring in a confined space accessed through access ports on the roof, called man-holes).
Following leak checks, final electrical connection tests, the process of filling the cryostat with 17~kton of \dword{lar} begins.
The installation of \dword{dpmod} requires meticulous planning and execution of all the tasks by well trained teams of technicians, riggers, and detector specialists.

The high level requirements for the \dword{dpmod} installation are summarised in the table~\ref{tab:requirements}.

In all the planning and future work, the preeminent requirement in the installation process is safety.
The installation of the \dword{dp} module presents a multitude of hazards that includes manipulation of heavy loads, work in tight areas and confined spaces, working at heights above the floor, use of chemicals (for instant as cleaning agents), use of cryogens, tests involving \dword{hv}.

Mitigation of these hazards begins with the strong review efforts and definition of specific safety rules by \dword{esh} teams of \dword{sdsd} and \dword{surf}.
All installation team members, both on surface and underground, will undergo rigorous formal safety training.
Any team member can stop work at any time for safety purposes.
Further details of the overall \dword{dune} safety plan are provided in the Technical Coordination volume of \dword{tdr}.
In addition, each section of this chapter provides further details on the evolving safety plan for the \dword{dp} module installation.


The high level risks associated to the \dword{dpmod} installation are summarised in the table~\ref{tab:risks}.

Access to the underground installation area for \dword{lbnf}, \dword{dune}, and \dword{jpo} personnel, as well as for \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} materials and equipment, will be provided by a single shaft, the mile-deep Ross Shaft.
Coordinating transport and ensuring on-time delivery of all items are therefore among the more challenging aspects of the \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune} endeavor.
The \dword{jpo} will establish a logistics organization for \dword{lbnf} and \dword{dune}, operated under the \dword{sdsd}, to verify deliveries to the point of receipt in South Dakota and coordinate transport of materials from there to the Ross Headframe.

Due to the cost of the \dword{cf} contracts and the risk of increased construction costs due to delays in delivery of materials, the shaft scheduling must be tightly controlled by \dword{lbnf}-\dword{cf} during construction.
The shaft is outfitted with a hoist that controls the cage and the skips.
The cage is used to transport people, equipment and materials, and the skips are used to bring up muck and transport over-sized equipment and materials.
The \dword{lbnf}-\dword{cf} \dword{cmgc} will coordinate overall usage of the Ross Shaft during this period.
To facilitate the flow of materials and equipment not related to \dword{cf} through the Ross Headframe, the \dword{jpo} will lease a warehouse facility within a maximum one-day roundtrip from \dword{surf} by truck.
It is expected that the lease of this facility, referred to as the \dword{sdwf}, will include warehouse space, personnel and \dword{wms} to inventory all incoming materials and equipment.
The location and the premisses  of the facility have not yet been identified.
Most detector and materials and equipment will be shipped to the \dword{sdwf}.
\dword{cf} material and cryogenics equipment are exceptions and will ship directly to \dword{surf}.

The \dword{sdsd} logistics organization will receive and inventory all goods shipped to the \dword{sdwf}, coordinate with the \dword{cmgc} and transport the material to the Ross Headframe in a just-in-time manner, and transport it underground and into the cavern.
The \dword{sdsd} logistics team oversees transportation of the cryostat (steel, foam, and membrane), the cryogenics system, the detector, and all related infrastructure not provided by the \dword{cf}.
\dword{lbnf} specifically oversees the cryostat and cryogenics system, which are discussed in detail in the \dword{lbnf} \dword{tdr}.
The space in the \dword{sdwf} must be shared between the detector components for the \dword{dpmod} and the \dword{lbnf} material to construct the next cryostat.

The \dword{surf} Facility Access Specification~\cite{bib:docdb328} defines the limitations on dimensions and weights for all materials to be transported underground, the most stringent of which are set by the Ross Shaft and Cage.
It is possible to bring material down the shaft underneath the cage or in the skip compartment as a slung load, but this is a much slower process and requires careful planning and review of detailed procedures for each trip.
In some cases this is the only possibility.
Most material will be brought underground inside the cage.
Figure~\ref{fig:shaft-cage} illustrates the new Ross Cage and summarizes its main dimensions.

\end{dunefigure}

The roundtrip travel time for the Ross cage is 17 minutes dominated by loading and unloading time (the actual travel time is 3.6 minutes each way).
Slung loads will require more than an hour round trip.
The Ross Headframe has no loading dock so careful planning of material loading and unloading of shipments is required.
All materials must arrive on a flatbed or curtain-sided chassis, and a
forklift will be available for unloading.
All deliveries, either from the \dword{sdwf} or direct to the Ross Headframe, require (1) coordination with the \dword{sdsd} logistics organization, and (2) minimum two weeks prior notice, per an advance delivery plan.
Logistics will provide a shipping manual to \dword{dune} institutions that will specify guidelines on required shipping data and cargo consignment such that the logistics organization can monitor shipping progress and no delays occur due to incomplete or missing documentation.
To prevent delays due to missing deliveries a minimum one month buffer of materials from detector components is foreseen.
This buffer will allow advance planning for the underground work, with confidence that all materials will be available as needed.
Sufficient space must be made available at the \dword{sdwf} and in the underground area to house this material.
To determine the storage space requirements and how much hoist time must be dedicated a detailed inventory of all detector equipment and infrastructure is needed.
The \dword{sdwf} staff in some occasion may de-consolidate or consolidate arriving cargo into appropriately sized boxes and crates, as needed, for delivery to \dword{surf}, to make the most efficient use of available trucks and the Ross Shaft.

The \dword{uit} supports the consortia installation effort and coordinates all the \dword{dune} underground work.
Each consortium is at all times responsible for the detector components and equipment that they provide to \dword{dune}.
The \dword{uit} supports the consortium installation work by providing the needed expertise to operate all cranes, platforms, hoists, and other specialized rigging equipment needed to move consortia equipment.
Special lifting devices are expected to be needed to install \dwords{crp}, \dword{hv} system \dword{fc} and cathode, and electronics.
Special devices may need to go through approval procedures and tests prior their use (tests that should be done on surface in the \dword{sdwf}).
The \dword{uit} leader is the responsible for supervising the \dword{uit} members, but the ultimate responsibility for all detector components will remain within the consortia even while the underground team is rigging or transporting these components.
This will be critical in case parts are damaged during transport or installation, as the consortia need to judge the necessary actions.
For this reason, a consortium representative or point of contact must be present when any work is performed on their equipment.
The consortium is also responsible for certifying that each installation step is properly performed.
The \dword{uit} is responsible for planning the work underground and communicating this plan to the consortia.
The consortia are responsible for planning the individual installation steps for their equipment and communicating this to the \dword{uit}.
This includes the reviewed and approved Consortium Installation Plan and all of the approved detailed Installation Procedures.
